# Music-Recommendation-System
This Project is based on ACM RecSys Challenge 2018 organized by Spotify, The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Johannes Kepler University, Linz.
We have used Million Playlist Dataset(MPD) provided in Challenge which contains 1 Million Playlist created by users on the spotify platform.
Each playlist in the MPD contains a playlist title, the track list (including track metadata) editing information (last edit time, 
number of playlist edits) and other miscellaneous information about the playlist.
