# Music-Recommendation-System
This Project is based on ACM RecSys Challenge 2018 organized by Spotify, The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Johannes Kepler University, Linz.
The goal of the challenge is to develop a system for the task of automatic playlist continuation. Given a set of playlist features, participants’ systems shall generate a list of recommended tracks that can be added to that playlist, thereby ‘continuing’ the playlist.
